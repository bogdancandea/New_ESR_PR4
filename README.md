# New_ESR_PR4
A redesigned PCB for the original ESR-PR4 ESR meter

Back in 2023, my ESR-PR4 broke due to an error (I measured a charged capacitor). My first thought was: oh well, it served me well until now—I'll just get another one. Identical.
However, over the years, the manufacturer had stopped production, and even the website had disappeared.

With some information from specialized forums and with the help of https://web.archive.org, I managed to access an archived version of the website that used to sell the product:

https://web.archive.org/web/20180327142201/http://x-roast.home.ro/

At that time, the author had published both the schematic and the software written for the microcontroller. So I was able to repair my device by replacing and reprogramming the microcontroller.

That’s when I got the idea to republish the information. Since the original information did not include the PCB, I designed a PCB version so that electronics enthusiasts could build the device themselves.

The author of the schematic and the software is unknown to me. I am using and republishing this information because it was publicly available at x-roast.home.ro. I have no commercial interest whatsoever.

There is a mismatch between the original schematic and the HEX file: pins 10 and 11 of the microcontroller are swapped.
The first unit I built had a few errors, including the swapped pins 10 and 11, which were fixed by cutting PCB traces and soldering wires.

The published version has already been corrected.

A new, smaller PCB version is currently in development, which I will publish only after I have had the chance to test it.
