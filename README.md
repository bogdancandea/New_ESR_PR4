# New_ESR_PR4
A redesigned PCB for the original ESR-PR4 ESR meter

Back in 2023, my ESR-PR4 broke due to an error (I measured a charged capacitor). My first thought was: oh well, it served me well until now—I'll just get another one. Identical.
However, over the years, the manufacturer had stopped production, and even the website had disappeared.

With some information from specialized forums and with the help of https://web.archive.org, I managed to access an archived version of the website that used to sell the product:

https://web.archive.org/web/20180327142201/http://x-roast.home.ro/

At that time, the author had published both the schematic and the software written for the microcontroller. So I was able to repair my device by replacing and reprogramming the microcontroller.

That’s when I got the idea to republish the information. Since the original information did not include the PCB, I designed a PCB version so that electronics enthusiasts could build the device themselves.

The author of the schematic and the software is unknown to me. I am using and republishing this information because it was publicly available at x-roast.home.ro. I have no commercial interest whatsoever.
